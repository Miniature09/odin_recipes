                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Rinse the pirk in cold water and pat it dry with kitchen paper. Add the pork marinade sauce onto the pork. Mix them well and leave it for 15 mins.</li>
                            <li>Cut the onion, Zucchini and potato into small cubes. Thin slice the mushrooms, cut the cabbage into small to medium size pieces and julienne cut the cucumber.</li>
                            <li>Add cooking oil to the cook and let it melt. Add Chunjang and stir it constantly on medium heat for 3-5 mins. Add the brown sugar and stir for 2-3 mins.</li>
                            <li>Scoop out the black bean paste(without the oil) and set it aside. Leave the oil in the wok to use in the next step.</li>

                            <li>Add the black bean paste into the wok and mix it in with the vegetables. Stir for 1-2 mins. Add the chicken stock, water and rice wine then simmer it for 5-7 mins on medium heat(cover the wok with a lid to make cooking process faster).</li>
                            <li>Add the Slurry into the wok then stir it.(This will thicken the black sauce)</li>
                            <li>Boil some water in a pot and add the noodles. Boil them until the noodles are cooked.</li>
                            <li>Rinse the noodles in cold water and drain. Put them into a serving bowl/plate. Add the black bean sauce on top of the noodles. Add some toppings if you want.</li>
                            <li>Mix the sauce and the noodles well with chopsticks and Dig in!</li>
                        </ol>
